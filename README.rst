Introduction
------------

Shotshaper is a sports projectile trajectory simulator. The code uses generic
solvers from the SciPy library to solve ODEs describing the trajectories.

The current focus of the simulator is on simulating disc golf discs. But
implementations are also provided for spherical projectiles with drag and spin.

Over time the simulator is intended to act as a library of sports projectiles
and their simulation for use in research and education.
